# The rest

### Next.js
---
* `withRouter` -> `useRouter()` hook
* Current work is mostly focused on a smaller, webpack-independent HTTP Server
* Sub pages _are_ happening, design is un-clear. Will likely have to fetch all their data ( no cascading )
* Next is considering a webpack-free future (Parcel, Metro, etc.)
